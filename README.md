Scripts useful for making RSFC network analysis.


*  fsLR2roizmatrix.m - extract mean RSFC time-series from ROIs on fs_LR surfaces, outputs correlation matrix. 
*  mat2cytoscape.m  - convert correlation matrix to 3-column format used for visulization in Cytoscape.
*  segregation.m  -  calculates system segregation (Chan et al. 2014). 
*  segregation_systype.m  -  calculates segregation of specific system types (e.g., Sensory-motor, Association).
